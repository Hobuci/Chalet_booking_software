Object Oriented Software Development @ Edinburgh Napier University

Task: The Napier Holiday Village requires a reservation system, which can create holiday chalet bookings for customers. Each booking should be allocated to a chalet; there are 10 chalets that may be allocated. 

 Each basic booking comprises the following attributes:

Attribute	                Type
Arrival Date		          Date
Departure Date	          Date
Booking Reference Number 	Auto increment starting at 1
ChaletID	                In range 1 to 10

In addition each booking is associated with a customer who has the following attributes:

Attribute	                  Type
Name	                      String
Address	                    String
Customer Reference Number 	Auto increment starting at 1

A customer may have many bookings, each booking must be associated with a customer.

Each booking will have a number of guests, up to a maximum of   6 (a customer is not necessarily a guest):

Attribute	      Type
Name	          String
Passport Number	String (max 10 chars)
Age 	          Integer 0-101


The cost of a basic chalet  is calculated as follows:

•	Basic cost per night for a chalet is £60 plus £25 for each guest staying
•	Any extras are charged per person, per night
•	The total cost of the booking is the sum of the nightly costs/

Holidays may have a number of extra options added on

•	Evening meals: A chalet may have evening meals I provided, the cost will be an extra £10 per guest per night  Meals can only be added for all guests for the duration of the booking. 
•	Breakfast: A holiday may have breakfast  added on to it, the cost will be an extra £5 per guest per day. Meals can only be added for all guests for the duration of the booking.
•	Car hire: Car hire costs £50 per day extra. When a car hire is associated with a booking the following should be noted, hire start date, hire end date and name of driver.

You will create a system that will allow bookings to be added, amended and deleted. The system should be able to cope with any number of customers, each of whom may have multiple bookings. It should be possible to amend a booking (including adding or removing extras) once it has been entered. The system should also be able to produce invoices showing the cost of a booking, the invoice should show the costs per night and the costs of any extras.

Optional extra functionality

1.	When creating a booking check to see if the selected chalet is available, if the new booking clashes with an existing booking then display an error message.
2.	Have the data layer store the bookings in a file or database in order to make them persistent.
